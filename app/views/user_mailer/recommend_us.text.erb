Dear <%=@message.message_recipient_name%>,

Here is something that you might like to consider for your children.

I find the postal tutoring provided by iwavez greatly beneficial and convenient to us. I feel their focus on raising the performance of students to international levels is especially noteworthy and commendable.  Please visit www.iwavez.com for more details.

Work arrives in your mailbox and student work is to be returned for marking every Monday. The work would be assessed and the parent would be informed of the results every week through the website.

Please visit www.iwavez.com or contact me for more information.

If you decide to enrol, please enter my name when you are asked about referral during enrolment. When you complete the enrolment, I will receive a provisional reward of $20 which is payable to me in four months of your enrolment being continuously good in standing. If the enrolment is cancelled before four months, the provisional reward would nullify.

Thanks,
<%=@parent.full_name%>
